 # Question 6

 Imagine that you are writing an automatic coaching app that gives feedback based on how much a person has run in a day compared to their goal.
 
 Create a constant called `targetDistance` of type `Double`.
 
 Create a variable called `currentDistanceRun` of type `Double`.
 
 Write a **single** if statement with multiple branches that provides feedback according to the following specifications:
 
 * when the person has run less than 10% of their target distance, print "Great start, keep it up!"
 * when the person has run between 45% and up to but not including 50% of their target distance, print "You're almost at halfway!"
 * when the person has run exactly half their target distance, print "Halfway there!"
 * when the person has run more than 90% of their target distance but not the entire target distance, print "Nearly done!"
 * when the person has run their entire target distance, print "GREAT JOB! You're finished the run."
 
 */
// Answer question 6 below
let targetDistance = Double()
var currentDistance = Double()
if currentDistance >= 0 && currentDistance <= 9{
    print("Great start, keep it up!")
}else if currentDistance > 45 && currentDistance < 50{
    print("You're almost at halfway!")
}else if currentDistance == 50 {
    print("You're almost at halfway!")
}else if currentDistance > 90  && currentDistance < 99{
    print("Nearly done!")
}else if currentDistance == 100{
    print("GREAT JOB!")
}
